# Email Scripts
Some misc scripts I use regarding email

## email\_helper.py
General purpose email reading/sending

## kitchen-update-email.py
Check if there is a new post on my website and email those signed up for email notifications

## reminder.py
Send an email based on args with the subject staring "REMINDER: ". This makes it easy to set up monthly/weekly/etc. reminders via crontab

## daily-update.py
Sends an update with news and weather about the day
